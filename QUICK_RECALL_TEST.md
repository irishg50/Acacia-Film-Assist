# Quick Recall Function Test

## Overview
The new quick recall system provides immediate access to recent chat history while maintaining efficient long-term memory storage. This gives you the best of both worlds - quick access to recent information and efficient long-term memory management.

## How It Works

### 1. **Long-Term Memory** (Efficient Storage)
- Updates every 3+ chat sessions OR 24+ hours
- Stores structured, summarized project information
- Efficient for long-term project context

### 2. **Quick Recall** (Immediate Access)
- Checks recent chat history from the last 24 hours
- Includes up to 50 recent messages
- Provides immediate context for current questions
- No waiting for memory updates

### 3. **Enhanced Context** (Combined Approach)
- Combines both long-term memory and recent context
- Prioritizes recent information for immediate questions
- Maintains long-term project understanding

## Test the New System

### Test 1: Immediate Recall
1. **Session 1**: Tell the system: "My documentary is about climate change in the Arctic, and my main character is Dr. Sarah Chen, a marine biologist."
2. **Session 2** (immediately after): Ask: "What is my documentary about and who is my main character?"
3. **Expected Result**: Should immediately recall the information from the recent context

### Test 2: Long-Term + Recent Context
1. **Session 1**: "My documentary is about climate change in the Arctic, and my main character is Dr. Sarah Chen, a marine biologist."
2. **Session 2**: "I decided to use a vérité style with minimal narration."
3. **Session 3**: "My budget is $150,000 and I'm targeting PBS for distribution."
4. **Session 4**: Ask: "What are all the details we've discussed about my documentary?"
5. **Expected Result**: Should recall all information from both long-term memory and recent context

### Test 3: Configuration Flexibility
You can adjust the system behavior by modifying these config values in `app/config.py`:

```python
# Project memory settings
PROJECT_MEMORY_UPDATE_HOURS = 24  # How often to update long-term memory
PROJECT_MEMORY_UPDATE_SESSIONS = 3  # How many sessions before updating memory
RECENT_CONTEXT_HOURS = 24  # How far back to look for recent context
RECENT_CONTEXT_MAX_MESSAGES = 50  # Max messages to include in recent context
```

## Benefits of This Approach

### ✅ **Immediate Response**
- No waiting for memory updates
- Recent information is immediately available
- Perfect for quick questions about recent discussions

### ✅ **Efficient Storage**
- Long-term memory updates only when needed
- Reduces API calls and processing overhead
- Maintains project context over time

### ✅ **Flexible Configuration**
- Adjustable time windows and message limits
- Can be tuned for different use cases
- Easy to optimize for your specific needs

### ✅ **Comprehensive Context**
- Combines both recent and long-term information
- Prioritizes recent information appropriately
- Maintains full project understanding

## Expected Results

With this new system, you should see:

1. **Immediate recall** of information from recent sessions
2. **Efficient long-term memory** that doesn't update too frequently
3. **Comprehensive context** that includes both recent and historical information
4. **Better performance** due to reduced unnecessary memory updates

## Debugging

If you want to see what context is being provided, you can add debug logging to see:
- What recent context is being retrieved
- What long-term memory is available
- How the enhanced context is being constructed

The system will now provide much more responsive recall while maintaining efficient long-term memory management.
