# TAL-E Beta Testers Guide for Fundraisers

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to the TAL-E Beta Test! TAL-E is an AI-powered assistant designed to help fundraisers work more efficiently with their documents, projects, and communications. As a beta tester, your feedback is invaluable—you'll help us identify what works well, what needs improvement, and what features are most useful for fundraising professionals like you.

TAL-E is built to streamline your workflow, whether you're drafting donor letters, organizing campaign materials, or analyzing reports. This guide will walk you through the main features of TAL-E and suggest ways you can test them in your daily work. As you explore, please note any bugs, confusing steps, or ideas for new features.

## 2. Getting Started

- **Sign Up & Log In:** Begin by creating your account or logging in with your credentials. If you have trouble accessing the platform, please reach out to our support team.
- **Main Interface Overview:** After logging in, you'll see the main workspace. The center area is for your chat with TAL-E, while the right column is dedicated to managing your projects and documents. This layout is designed to keep your resources and conversations easily accessible.
- **Navigation Tips:** Use the menus and buttons in the right column to:
  - Create and switch between projects
  - Upload and manage documents
  - Start new chat sessions or revisit previous ones
  - Adjust your settings as needed

Take a moment to click around and get familiar with where things are. If something isn't clear, make a note of it for your feedback.

## 3. Project Management

Projects in TAL-E help you keep your fundraising work organized. Each project can contain its own set of documents and chat history, making it easy to separate different campaigns, events, or donor groups.

- **Creating Projects:** Click the "Add Project" or similar button in the right column. Give your project a clear, descriptive name (e.g., "Spring Gala 2024" or "Major Donor Outreach").
- **Switching Projects:** Use the dropdown menu at the top of the right column to move between your projects. When you switch, the document list and chat history will update to show only the items related to the selected project.
- **Renaming & Deleting Projects:** To rename a project, look for an "Edit" or pencil icon next to the project name. To delete, use the "Delete" or trash icon—be careful, as this will permanently remove all documents and chats associated with that project.

**Tips for Testing:**
- Try creating several projects that reflect your real fundraising activities.
- Switch between projects and observe how your documents and chat history change.
- Rename a project and check that the new name appears everywhere.
- Delete a test project and confirm that it's removed from your list.

As you test, consider: Is it easy to organize your work? Are the project features intuitive? Let us know what you think!

## 4. Document Management

Documents are at the heart of your fundraising work. TAL-E lets you upload, organize, and select documents for each project, making it easy to keep your materials in one place.

- **Uploading Documents:** Use the "+ Add Files" button in the right column to upload files to your current project. You can add proposals, reports, donor lists, or any other materials you use. There is a file size limit (e.g., 1MB), so try uploading a variety of document types and sizes.
- **Selecting Documents for Chat:** After uploading, you can select which documents you want TAL-E to use in your chat. Use the checkboxes next to each document to include or exclude them from your current session. Selected documents will be referenced by TAL-E when answering your questions.
- **Removing Documents:** If you need to remove a document, use the delete or trash icon next to its name. This will permanently remove it from the project.

**Tips for Testing:**
- Upload different types of files (PDFs, Word docs, etc.) and see how TAL-E handles them.
- Select and deselect documents, then ask TAL-E questions to see how its responses change.
- Remove a document and check that it disappears from the list and is no longer available in chat.

## 5. Chatting with TAL-E

TAL-E is designed to help you get the most out of your documents. You can ask questions, request summaries, or draft communications—all within the chat interface.

- **Starting a New Chat:** Click the "Start a New Chat" button to begin a fresh conversation. Each chat is linked to your current project and selected documents.
- **Using Documents in Chat:** When you have documents selected, TAL-E will use their content to answer your questions. You can change which documents are active at any time during the chat.
- **Example Prompts for Fundraisers:**
  - "Summarize this grant proposal."
  - "Draft a thank-you letter for a major donor based on this report."
  - "What are the key statistics in this document?"
  - "List the main goals of our Spring Gala campaign."

Try asking TAL-E about your uploaded documents, or request it to draft or edit fundraising materials.

**Tips for Testing:**
- Start chats with different combinations of documents selected.
- Use a variety of prompts—summaries, drafting, data extraction, etc.
- Notice how TAL-E's responses change based on the documents you include.

## 6. Chat History

TAL-E keeps a record of your past conversations, making it easy to revisit previous work or continue ongoing discussions.

- **Viewing Past Chats:** The "Chat History" section in the right column lists your recent conversations for the current project. Click on any chat to view its messages.
- **Renaming Chats:** Give your chats descriptive names to help you find them later. Look for an edit or rename option next to each chat in the history list.
- **Continuing a Chat:** You can pick up where you left off by selecting a previous chat and sending a new message.

**Tips for Testing:**
- Start several chats and check that they appear in the history list.
- Rename a chat and confirm the new name is saved.
- Reopen a past chat and continue the conversation—see if TAL-E remembers the context.

As you test, consider: Is it easy to find and manage your past chats? Does the chat history help you stay organized?

## 7. Collaboration Features

TAL-E is designed to support teamwork. Some collaboration features may be available, such as sharing projects or chat sessions with colleagues, or exporting content for use in other tools.

- **Sharing Projects or Chats:** If enabled, you can invite team members to view or contribute to your projects and chat sessions. Look for a "Share" button or link in the project or chat menus. (If this feature is not yet available, please let us know if it would be useful for your workflow!)
- **Exporting Content:** You may be able to export chat transcripts or generated documents for use in emails, reports, or presentations. Look for an "Export" or "Download" option in the chat or document menus.
